# Student Grades Tracker

This project is a simple Java-based application created for an assignment at **LaSalle College** as part of the **Java course**. The application allows for tracking of students and their grades for various classes. There is no database used in this project; instead, it utilizes basic data structures to store and manipulate student and grade information.

## Features

- Add students to the system with their name and ID.
- Assign grades to students for different classes.
- Display a list of students and their grades.
- Calculate the average grade for a student across all classes.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have **Java** installed on your system.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git`
   
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd repository-name`


3. Compile and run the Java files using your preferred IDE or by using the terminal.

   ```bash

### Usage

1. Upon running the program, you will be prompted to add students and assign grades.
2. You can choose to display the list of students and their grades, or calculate the average grade for a student.
3. The system does not save any data permanently (no database used), so all data is lost after the program is closed.
   
Example

* Adding a Student 
* Name: John Doe 
* ID: 12345 
* Class: Math 
* Grade: 85 

   
## Technologies Used

* Java for programming the application.
* No database used; simple data structures (e.g., arrays or lists) for storing information.
